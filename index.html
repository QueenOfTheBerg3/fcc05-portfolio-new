        <h1>The Learning Process</h1>

        <h3>The new curriculum teaches by example.</h3>

        <p>Each lesson is a mini-challenge of a temporary project that will probably be seen by nobody in particular.</p>

        <p>Apart from the joy and satisfaction derived from creating the desired outcome by following the detailed steps, there is no real, tangible project at the end of each section of the curriculum. </p>

        <p>The Project Challenges, which make up the Certification, are, in fact, more permantent in nature, and their links make up part of the Certificate received.</p>

        <p>Having completed the Responsive Web Design Curriculum, and after doing some other courses, I discovered that FreeCodeCamp had redesigned said curriculum.  It seemed like a challenge just waiting to happen.</p>

        <p>Therefore and thus, after some time, I embarked on the New Curriculum, completing and redesigning both the added challenges and the Certification Projects.</p>

        <p>Another interesting thing happened:-<br/>

        I got the old black laptop out and booted up into MX Linux, but the keyboard was faulty.  Random keypresses would register at a high rate of knots, causing interesting effects.</p>

        <p>The keyboard did type characters, but the keypresses were random and often.  So, we had no choice but to disconnect the black laptop's keyboard yet again.</p>

        <p>Now, I really don't like typing on a laptop keyboard and prefer a standard keyboard by far.  The silver laptop, being older and smaller, had a functional keyboard, but I did not enjoy having to find the <em>small</em> Function keys along the top and of course, it has no number pad on the right hand side.</p>

        <p>So, I have 1 keyboard to use between 2 laptops.</p>

        <p>Finding Barrier to be an easy installation on both windows and linux, to connect the mouse and keyboard, it became my 'bluetooth' equivalent in no time.</p>

        <p>However, it seems that the keyboard capture has become slightly entagled, and the cursor does not always follow the characters that I type into the FreeCodeCamp curriculum input area.  <br/>Is this anomoly due to Barrier, or is it caused  by something else?.  Not sure.</p>

        <p>The only (easy) solution seemed to be to type the answers into VSCode and then Copy and Paste said anwers into the input box in the Curriculum. </p>

        <p>Therefore, I have a complete record of some of the lesson challenges, which means I have a number of extra projects that could have been included on this portfolio page.</p>

        <p>Fun and fiddly projects.</p>

        <ul>

            <li>Fun

                <ol>

                    <li>Ferris Wheel</li>

                    <li>Flappy Penguin</li>

                </ol>

            </li>

            <li>Fiddly

                <ol>

                    <li>Balance Sheet</li>

                </ol>

            </li>

        </ol>
